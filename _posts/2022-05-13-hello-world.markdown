Hello world! This blog is created with Jekyll and hosted on Github pages. Getting it setup and deployed took a couple hours over a few weeks, and it looks good out of the box! I plan to use this site to develop my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and Linear Algebra. Categories not necessarily equally weighted, and out of distribution posts possible. 

Tutorials for setting up Jekyll are abundant and robust. Github pages likewise. The challenge is learning how to configure frameworks with dozens of options. Over time this site will serve to document my learning progression. Looking back at old code is cathartic, because we get to see how much we have grown since. Beyond technical challenges, I have many ideas of what to write about: Linear Algebra formulations, data visualization, signal processing, finding employment, etc. Looking forward to discovering and grokking interesting concepts here!
