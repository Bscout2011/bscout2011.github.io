## Recommended Resources

Open source books and websites which enabled my data career.

### Software

![Data science workflow](/img/about/data-science.png)

A good data scientist is proficient at the entire transform, visualise, model workflow. [R 4 Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) teaches practical skills in R which can be rapidly implemented on a project.

[The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is similar resource for Python using Jupyter notebooks. Pretty much every data job requires *extensive* experience with Python, so this is worth practicing.

Real businesses store data in SQL warehouses. The *extract* in <ins>E</ins>TL is typically a SQL dialect. Use [cheat sheets](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-cheat-sheet/), or [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) for help translating.

      <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/">Vector, Matrices, and Least Squares</a> introduces multidemensional data in the best kind of way. Highly recommended for those interested in modeling.

[Kalman and Bayesian filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python) is another open source book built in Jupyter. While mainly applicable for robotics and control, the way the material is presented is intuitive and rigorous.

[The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) is a graduate level textbook on model regression and classification. Currently working through this.
